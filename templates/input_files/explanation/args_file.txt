########## <begin> Tip for specifying files
# AutoMicroED does not need pathway information (like /home/kimd999/auto_cryoEM/microED/KL/single_frames/merge_2/crystal_2/2021-03-03-133857).
# Please put basefile name only and DO NOT add file extension (e.g. mrc or mrcs).

# If input mrc is individual frame (for example, 2021-03-03-133857_0001.mrc, 2021-03-03-133857_0002.mrc and so on), then this base filename could be
# 2021-03-03-133857_????

# However, if input mrc is stack (for example, 2021-03-03-133857.mrcs), then this base filename could be
# 2021-03-03-133857

# Calibrated sample-detector distance (mm) 

# If d_calibrated is same across all input mrc, basefile does not need to be specified.

# However, if d_calibrated is different across input mrc files, then specify as

d_not_calibrated 2021-03-03-133857_???? 592.77
# Uncalibrated (as displayed in Krios) sample-detector distance (mm) 
# Once a user enters here, a true distance (calibrated) will be added
by AutoMicroED using the calibration coefficients specified below.

d_calibration_coef 1.8 -14
# This formula uses y=mx+b where y=d_calibrated and x=d_uncalibrated
# The 1st value is m, and the 2nd value is b.
# For example, if a user enters 430 (as Krios displays) as 'd_not_calibrated',
# 'd_calibrated' will be 430 x 1.8 - 14 = 760
# This example calibration formula is correct only for PNNL_Krios, it could be different for other cryo-EM machines.

# If a user specified both 'd_calibrated' and ' d_not_calibrated',
# AutoMicroED will not calibrate ' d_not_calibrated'. It will just use
