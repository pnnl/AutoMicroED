Case 1) When a user provides mrc input, the mrc input list file that has list of input mrc should be specified.

Then AutoMicroED will run mrc2smv.

Please see an example (e.g. (AutoMicroED git repo)/templates/mrc_is_stack/tutorial/Acetaminophen/when_user_provided_mrc_input/aceta_mrc_tutorial.list)




Case 2) When a user provides smv input, the smv input list file that has list of input smv should be specified. 

For example, run
/gpustorage/automation/MicroED/Scripts/AutoMicroED/run_all.py aceta_smv_folders.list aceta_arg_tutorial_smv_provided.txt

Then AutoMicroED will not run mrc2smv.

Please see an example (e.g. (AutoMicroED git repo)/templates/mrc_is_stack/tutorial/Acetaminophen/when_user_provided_smv_input/aceta_smv_folders.list).

This example has list of smv folders like "/gpustorage/DN/microED/small/acet/protein_False/tutorial/output/here_20210813_19_15_52/archive/165749merged/img" that contains smv files (for example, 165749merged_0033.img). These smv files should have filenames as *_????.img as if it was generated by AutoMicroED's mrc2smv command. For example, 165749merged_0001.img, 165749merged_0002.img, 165749merged_0003.img ... 165749merged_0120.img

Please put smv files at "img" folder.

The second last sub-folder will be used as each smv representative.
For example, "165749merged" will be used from "/gpustorage/DN/microED/small/acet/protein_False/tutorial/output/here_20210813_19_15_52/archive/165749merged/img"
