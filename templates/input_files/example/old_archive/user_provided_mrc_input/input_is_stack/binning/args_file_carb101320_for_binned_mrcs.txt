! Number of "fast" pixels in a data image along X. Used by XYCORR, INIT, COLSPOT, IDXREF.

! OSCILLATION_RANGE
! Oscillation range of each data image in degree.
! This will be automatically calculated as r x E
! For ketone data, 0.899999976 worked
! I know that positive multiple of 0.0001 is "required", but for ketone data, it was not required.
! If there are 130 images for -65 and 65, using 1 makes sense
! It must be a positive multiple of 0.0001. Thus, a value like 0.000125 would be incorrect! XDS assumes a right handed rotation of the crystal about the rotation axis when proceeding to the next data image. No sensible default value can be provided and the user must insert the correct value. For detectors with no read-out noise like the PILATUS an optimal choice for the oscillation range would match half of the crystal's mosaicity (defined as the standard deviation of the reflecting range). A further reduction of the oscillation range could lead to problems in the accurate determination of extremely low background and unreliably processed data.
! This describes a "fine-sliced" data set with each image covering an oscillation range of 0.1 Â°.
! Parameter is used by IDXREF

ROTATION_AXIS 1 0 0
! Direction cosines of the rotation axis with respect to the laboratory system.

! 0 means we do not know. Chemical formula alone doesn't tell SPACE_GROUP_NUMBER of course.

TEST_RESOLUTION_RANGE 10 0.5
! Resolution range (angstrom) for including reflections in the calculation of
Rmeas when analysing the intensity data for space group symmetry in
the CORRECT step.
! Example: TEST_RESOLUTION_RANGE= 10.0 4.0 -> Strong
data between 10 to 4 angstrom resolution are used for the tests in order to
obtain a strong contrast in the Rmeas values between correct and
incorrect choices for the space group. Parameter is used by CORRECT

!X-RAY_WAVELENGTH 
! Wavelength of the incident X-ray beam (angstrom).
! Automatically determined by
! 0.0251 for 200 kv
! 0.0196 for 300 kv
! old explanation -> For example, it could be 0.92 when a synchrotron data set collected at wavelength 0.92 angstrom. Used by IDXREF
! Since there is no X-RAY in microED, this is actually wavelength of electron
