## Troubleshooting
   - When xds executable is broken with a message of "forrtl: No such file or directory", re-downloading the executable solves it.
   - When xds (xds_par) resulted in 
      - "!!! ERROR !!! CANNOT READ XPARM.XDS" without an obvious reason
         -  re-trying after few days works again.
      - AUTOMATIC DETERMINATION OF SPOT SIZE PARAMETERS HAS FAILED.
         - You may want to exclude empty frames from processing.
         - If your frames show few reflections, you could increase
            - the size of batches from their default to DELPHI=10.
         - Alternatively, you may restart the INTEGRATE step
            - after specifying appropriate values in XDS.INP for:
               - REFLECTING_RANGE=   
               - REFLECTING_RANGE_E.S.D.=
               - BEAM_DIVERGENCE=  
               - BEAM_DIVERGENCE_E.S.D.=
      - CANNOT OPEN OR READ FILE bin1_01.tmp
         - Presumably, the independent jobs supposed to have been started in the INTEGRATE step have not run properly.
         - This could be due to incomplete installation of XDS where some of the executables of the package are not included in the search path.
