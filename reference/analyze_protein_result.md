## Analyze protein result
   - In output/(run date-time)/(SPACE_GROUP)/(UNIT_CELL)
      - Space group identification 
      	 - self-explanatory in a folder name
         - (alternatively) grep " Space group  Flack_x" -A 1 shelxt_input_from_xdsconv.lxt
      - Unit cell constants identification
      	 - self-explanatory in a folder name
         - (alternatively) grep UNIT_CELL_CONSTANTS XSCALE.LP
      - Merged COMPLETENESS of DATA identification
         - grep COMPLETENESS -A 25 XSCALE.LP
   - In output/(run date-time)/(SPACE_GROUP)/(UNIT_CELL)
      - Open AUTO_target.1.mtz (Coot -> File -> Open MTZ, mmCIF, fcf or phs)
      - Open AUTO_target.1.pdb (Coot -> File -> Open Coordinates)
