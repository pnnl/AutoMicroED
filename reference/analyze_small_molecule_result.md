## Analyze small molecule result
   - In output/(run date-time)/(SPACE_GROUP)/(UNIT_CELL)
      - Space group identification 
      	 - self-explanatory in a folder name
         - (alternatively) grep " Space group  Flack_x" -A 1 shelxt_input_from_xdsconv.lxt
      - Unit cell constants identification
      	 - self-explanatory in a folder name
         - (alternatively) grep UNIT_CELL_CONSTANTS XSCALE.LP
      - Merged COMPLETENESS of DATA identification
         - grep COMPLETENESS -A 25 XSCALE.LP
   - In output/(run date-time)/(SPACE_GROUP)/(UNIT_CELL)/shelxl_no_cif
      - Open sol1.fcf (Coot -> File -> Open MTZ, mmCIF, fcf or phs)
      - Open sol1.res (Coot -> File -> Open Coordinates)
      	- (For macOS, Coot can be installed at /Applications/ccp4-7.0)
	   - Resolution can be known by _reflns_d_resolution_high
	      - For example, if "grep _reflns_d_resolution_high sol1.fcf" shows _reflns_d_resolution_high  0.9003
	      - the minimal resolution is 0.9003 Angstrom.
	      - There are other local areas whose resolutions are worse than this minimal resolution.
	      - However, it is customary to report this minimum resolution both in x-ray crystallography and cryo-EM.
   - In output/(run date-time)/(SPACE_GROUP)/(UNIT_CELL)/shelxl_with_cif
      - .cif file is generated
